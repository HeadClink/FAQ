            What does HeadClink do exactly?
        </summary>
        <p>
            We connect presenters around the world by real-time video or audio chats to get feedback from the evaluators. 
            This means that you would be delivering your speech, presentation, etc to a similar audience before your 
            actual audience, resulting in better performance. 
        </p>

            What if I donâ€™t find a real-time evaluator?
        </summary>
        <p>
            In the case of not connecting with a live evaluator, we also have a forum where you could post a recording of your video.
             You would get feedback from many evaluators over a time period of your choosing. 
        </p>

            You could also use the ClinkBucks to buy paid services on the platform.

            You get the opportunity to practice and receive 
            valuable feedback on your presentations/speeches before facing the judging audience.

            Do I have to pay to use the service?

        <p>
            Essentially no. You do not have to pay to use the platform as many of our features are free. However, we 
            do have subscription packages and a few items that you could buy if you enjoy using our platform and want to upgrade.
